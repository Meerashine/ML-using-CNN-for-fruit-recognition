# ML-using-CNN-for-fruit-recognition

The repository contains the fruit recognition ML code on CNN which predicts the fruit name and give out a recepie recommendation. This unit can be used as a unit for several firms like cooking app, recepie recommendations for fitness people...etc.The main objective of using CNN for this project is due to the image recognition and for much better accuracy on prediction. With increasing the number of layers and hyper parameter tuning ,we ahve made the accuracy to about 93.344 percentage.

The data sets were obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits which contain 113 categories of fruits and vegetables.

The major objective was to come up with an app that can help people to find out recepies easily with the vegetables or fruits that they have at home. The recognition of fruit and the basic outlay of the app is also done in the code.The UI and the design part needs improvements.

# Tools used:

* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Anaconda
* Jupyter Notebook
* MySql
* Flask
* python

*Note: further improovements are done on this code for better accuracy and for design changes.
